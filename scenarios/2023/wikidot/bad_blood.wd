+ Bad Blood - Shotgun Scenario Entry
+++ Introduction
 Sometimes a **N@TO** goes bad. Bullets fly, blood is spilt, good people die, shit goes **FUBAR**. This Shotgun Scenario is for one such occasion. It can be used by the Handler in lieu of a TPK or as a stand-alone oneshot. A pregenerated Outlaw Cell can be found in **Statblocks.** The Agent begin badly injured, having been detained by local authorities and handcuffed to their hospital beds. Additionally, during their botched N@TO, they were infected with an Unnatural vector which now burns its way through their bloodstreams. 

+++ Rude Awakening
 Play begins with a seemingly normal **Home Scene** for the **Agents**, a brutally fleeting time for recuperation before their next N@TO. However, cracks in reality begin to show. An **Agent’s** burner phone licks their ear, a **Bond** gleefully crunches away at a cereal bowl filled with torn fingernails and faecal matter, a pet animal smiles with human teeth at them from the corner of a darkened room. 

 At the height of this waking nightmare, a glisteningly maw bursts from the Agent’s sternum with a horrific tearing sensation. Relishing every word, it speaks in the Agent’s own voice; //“SWEET. THING. BEAUTIFUL. THING. BLESSED. COMMUNION. SOON. SOON. FEAST. INDULGE. FEED. ME.”// This costs **SAN 1/1D6** to the **Unnatural.** 

 The Agent then awakes at **1/2 HP.** Their   bodies are soaked in sweat and mouth tasting of bile, handcuffed to a hospital bed. The quiet beeping of a heart rate monitor runs parallel to the pounding in their ears. The nearby red-fluorescent glow of a digital clock reads **3:00 am. INTx5 or Navigate** can reveal the Agent is either on the **fifth or sixth floor**. 

 Agents can attempt to escape their bindings via various means. **Criminology or DEXx5** allows for the Agent to dislocate their own thumbs to slip their cuffs for the cost of **1 HP.**   **Special Training (Lockpicks)** or **Craft (Locksmith)** can compromise the simple locks. 

 Conversely, an Agent can roll **STRx5** at the cost of **1D4 HP**, defying logic by tearing the handrail from the bed as their blood pumps and their mouth tastes of ash. Realising the anatomical impossibility of this feat costs **0/1D4 SAN** to the **Unnatural.** 

 Other clever plans, like faking a medical emergency with **Medicine** or utilising any **hypergeometry**   the Agent may have, can also work. 

+++ Tweedledee And Tweedledum
 After the hospital entered the details of the Agents’ bizarre affliction into their databases, **Program** data-trawling software was immediately alerted to a potential incursion. **Mr. WEST** and **Mr. EAST**, impersonating CDC personnel, were dispatched to investigate. 

 The pair are dressed in dark suits, with CDC IDs and concealed **Medium Pistols** (requires an **Alertness roll** to notice). They will enter one of the Agents’ hospital rooms to interrogate them. Ideally, this should be an Agent who has failed to escape so far. **Mr. WEST** throws his coat over the CCTV camera, as **Mr. EAST** withdraws a syringe of insulin menacingly. 

 The pair will play Good Cop/Bad Cop, trying to elicit information from the Agent as to their prior N@TO, their contacts within the Outlaws and the nature of their disease. Despite being completely in the dark, they pretend to know far more about the Agent’s affliction than they actually do. **HUMINT** can identify their doubletalk; promising treatments whilst simultaneously demanding explanations. 

 However, during this interaction, the Agent’s heart-rate begins to erratically climb as their interrogators’ words become indistinct and garbled. They can smell the sweat in their pores and the blood in their veins, filling their nostrils in a rich, buttery aroma. A perverse hunger yearns for satiation, to sup upon the viscousness of sweet blood. This urge costs **0/1 SAN** to the **Unnatural.** 

+++ Let’s Get This Party Started
 Unfortunately the Program are not the only ones who took note of the Agents’ affliction. A **sect of cultists**, perhaps related to the Agents’ botched N@TO, have been alerted to the Agents’ blessed blood. The cultists, referred to herein as **The Pack**, arrive at the hospital armed to the teeth, wired on drugs and disguised in various Halloween masks, immediately beginning an all-out assault. 

 The Pack intend on capturing the Agents and ritualistically removing their hearts so that they too may commune with the entity in their blood. They’ll prefer to chase down the injured Agents and beat them into submission, but will result to making “ **Flesh** **Wound** **” Called Shots** if the Agents put up any armed resistance. 

 Anyone else, the hospital staff, any first responders and especially the Program operatives, are irrelevant to The Pack’s plans. The mad cultists have no qualms slaughtering them all. 

+++ Getting Out Alive
 Once The Pack cuts the power, kicks down the front doors and guns down the receptionist all hell breaks loose inside the hospital. **Mr. WEST** and **Mr. EAST** exchange panicked glances, draw their handguns, call for backup on their burners and abandon the restrained Agents to their rooms. Meanwhile gunshots echo throughout the building, as late-night staff desperately flee the violence and patients cower inside their rooms. 

 For Agents who have not yet escaped their bindings, it’s likely some hospital staff may take refuge inside their room. **Persuade** or **CHRx5** can be used to convince them to let the Agent out. Conversely, the staff member could be **the Weasel**, the member of **The Pack** who works as a hospital administrator and alerted them of the Agents’ condition. The Weasel will quickly drop their facade of sanity, perhaps after slitting the throat of another staff member. They gleefully rant about the Agents’ //“sanctified//   //blood”//, jealously proclaiming that they //“keep the Mother’s sweet love all to// //themselves”//. 

 If not stopped, the Weasel will clumsily straddle the Agent and attempt to stab open their chest. The Agent can oppose the Weasel’s efforts with **Unarmed rolls,** either ramming the cultist’s scalpel in his own neck or kicking him into a heart rate monitor in a shower of sparks. 

 Meanwhile, the other Agents will be hunted throughout the hospital by members of The Pack, in blood-soaked hospital corridors lit only by crimson red emergency lighting. 

 Agents can arm themselves with all manner of improvised weapons, like scalpels, isopropyl alcohol molotov cocktails, wire garrotes, motorised bonesaws or syringes filled with bleach. They must avoid shattered glass on the ground (deals **1 DMG** and inflicts **-20%** on relevant rolls until the shard is removed with **First Aid**) or even various hunting snares scattered around the hospital by The Pack (**1D6 DMG**, immobilises victim until a **STRx5 -40% roll** is made). 

+++ Power In The Blood
 The Unnatural disease afflicting the Agents fills them with a dark hunger for human blood. Indulging in this primal desire does have its advantages, especially to the injured Agents in their desperate fight for survival. 

 Any **SAN lost** to this indulgence regenerates an equal amount of **HP.** However, this is not without its risks. If an Agent reaches a **Breaking Point** during this scenario, they begin to degenerate into a more savage form. They gain **+20%** to all **physical rolls** and deal **+2 Unarmed/Melee damage**. 

 If an Agent reaches a **second Breaking Point**, they succumb even more to the madness in their bloodstream. They gain **+40%** to all **physical rolls**, deal **double Unarmed/Melee damage** and take **half damage** from any **physical attacks** (aside from fire). 

 The consequences for further indulgence is left up to the Handler’s discretion. Maybe the Agent mutates into a **Liveliest Awfulness** or a **Haedus Nigritia.** 

 Devouring an IV bag filled with universal donor blood (easily found with **Search** within the hospital) is **1D4 SAN/HP**. 

 Lapping up the blood of a deceased individual is **1D6 + 1 SAN/HP.** 

 Ripping the throat out of a living person and supping deeply from the arterial spray is **1D8 + 2 SAN/HP.** 

+++ Dead Flesh, Fresh Meat
 In the event that an Agent is killed, completely disabled, overcome by their affliction or escapes the hospital early in the scenario, their player can take control of **Mr. EAST** or **Mr. WEST**, if the pair of Program operatives are still alive. 

 Conversely, particularly devious Handlers could even allow the player to take control of **a member of The Pack**, as they hunt down the other Agents in the name of blessed communion. 

+++ Resolution
 Agents can escape the hospital via sneaking or fighting their way down through the hospital towards the ground floor entrances or sub-basement’s   carpark. Conversely, they can risk a multiple storey fall by climbing down from a window or elevator shaft. 

 Agents who do not escape cleanly may be pursued on foot or via car by any remaining members of The Pack, or even operatives from the Program. 

 Agents who manage to gain access to a cellular device can call A-Cell for assistance. Whether A-Cell helps the infected Agents is up to the Handler, as is whether they can even be cured in the first place. Although it wouldn't be the first time the Outlaws exploited an Agent corrupted by the Unnatural. 

 Regardless, escaping the hospital alive grants **+1D4 SAN.**
