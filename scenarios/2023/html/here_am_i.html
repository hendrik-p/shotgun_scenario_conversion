    A fundamentalist Christian pastor gets hold of a text from the Holy Land.

    The fire demon gave him a revelation, one that he wants to hear: the rapture is coming and only God’s most holiest warriors will make the cut. He shares this news with his congregation. They keep the fire stoked by burning “woke” books. The fire demon bestows them the knowledge of the burned books; the cognitive dissonance between what they believe and what they are learning is driving them to madness.

    Agents are told Delta Green had been attempting to get ahold of the book, but due to a shortage of personnel from turmoil in the Middle East, they were unable to intercept the buyer, a pastor of a Southern Baptist Church.

   <span class="c1">
    Once referred to as Zahara Al-Qlithoth, this djinn is bound to a book (“Hamsat Al-Shajira Al-Mutwahjha” - “Whispers of the Incandescent Thicket”) and has been in and out of the antiquarian black market since the 1920s.

  <p class="c0">
   <span>
    The djinn has been bound by Mitchell and it restricted to the church grounds. When it cannot detect a human’s presence, it rolls around like a blazing tumbleweed, that does not scorch the grass or land underneath (
   </span>
   <span class="c8">

   <span class="c1">
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c0">
   <span class="c1">
    If discovered by the Agents, the Djinn will attempt to bargain with them, offering them Unnatural skill or other knowledge through TRANSFERENCE, but each attempt to learn calls for a POW x 5 check. On a Fumble, the Djinn overtakes the Agent and lives in their head.

    The Djinn is the same as an ifrit, but has two additional abilities:
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c0">
   <span class="c3">
    *TRANSFERENCE
   </span>
   <span class="c4">
    : A target burned by the Ifrit shares the knowledge of a ritual the target knows with the Ifrit. On an additional turn, the Ifrit shares a different ritual with the target (pay the SAN cost to learn). This repeats until the target is dead.

    : Any person within 10m of the Ifrit shares the knowledge of books burned by the Ifrit, as if they had just read the book and studied it extensively. Any rituals within a book are also learned instantly.

    If members of the congregation feel comfortable with Agents, they can share the revelation of the appearance of the Burning Bush, when their pastor read from an ancient text from the Holy Land and the random fires began appearing inside of the chapel.

   <span class="c1">
    Every time a book is burned, the knowledge within is instantly transferred to those nearby. These close-minded fundamentalist Christians burning radical left-wing texts are being slapped with the hardest cognitive dissonance they have ever experienced and it is causing terrible internal conflict and turmoil.

    The congregation has an air of discontent around them. They engage in the nightly book burnings, but each day they seem to be more torn about it. Some of them stop, but others become emboldened by their fervor, boisterously traipsing about the town and causing troubles for non-believers and doubters. They may become violent if the Agents do not stop the book burnings in time.

    EXTINGUISHING
   </span>
   <span class="c4">
    : To extinguish an ifrit is like putting out a very stubborn fire. Water inflicts 1D4 damage per gallon; a bucket of sand does 1D4 damage; a hand-held fire extinguisher does 1D6.
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c0">
   <span class="c4">
    If the ifrit has even 1 HP remaining at the end of the round, it immediately returns to 8 HP at the beginning of the next round, and then it grows (see GROWTH).

  </p>
  <p class="c0">
   <span class="c3">
    FIERY TOUCH
   </span>
   <span class="c4">
    : With a successful attack, the ifrit sets its target on fire for 1D4 damage per turn. With a critical hit, the target suffers 1D8 damage per turn.

  </p>
  <p class="c0">
   <span class="c3">
    FLAME IMMERSION
   </span>
   <span class="c4">
    : This attack is possible after the ifrit has grown to full size (STR 18). It flows over a target, with the attack counting as a grappling roll, and inflicts Lethality 20% burns every turn that the target remains pinned.
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c0">
   <span class="c3">
    GROWTH
   </span>
   <span class="c4">
    : The first turn an ifrit appears, it has STR 2 and HP 8. At the beginning of each turn, it gains +2 STR and +1 HP, until it reaches maximum size at STR 18 and HP 16.
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c0">
   <span class="c3">
    NON-TERRENE
   </span>

   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c0">
   <span class="c3">
    TRANSCENDENT
   </span>
   <span class="c4">
    : Intangible, an ifrit is immune to physical harm. It can be extinguished (see EXTINGUISHING), and it takes full damage from hypergeometry.
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c0">
   <span class="c3">
    *KNOWLEDGE CLEANSING
   </span>
   <span class="c4">
    : Any person within 10m of the Ifrit shares the knowledge of books burned by the Ifrit, as if they had just read the book and studied it extensively. Any rituals within a book are also learned instantly.
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c0">
   <span class="c3">
    UNNATURAL BIOLOGY
   </span>
   <span class="c4">
    : The ifrit’s physiology would baffle any biologist. Making a called shot for “vitals” or another apparently vulnerable area inflicts normal damage, with no special game effect.
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c0">
   <span class="c3">
    RITUALS:
   </span>
   <span class="c4">
    Some ifrits know Call Forth Those From Outside (Ifrits; Qu-Tugkwa). An ifrit may learn a new ritual by burning someone who knows it, or a book containing it.
