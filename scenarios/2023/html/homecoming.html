    The entity Janusz has taken over the body of a 27-year old U.N peacekeeper Jason Hauser, who was killed in an attack during an operation in Afghanistan. Jason Hauser returned to his home village of Makina on the Canadian side of the Canada-US border three months ago, when he began killing people to preserve his fading essence.

    If the Agents contact U.N with a successful Bureaucracy roll (+60, +30 if you have any military skills), the team discovers that Jason Hauser's obituary has not been altered and there is no official record of Jason Hauser's survival. A call to the official in charge reveals the same: it's impossible that Jason Hauser has returned home. The next day, the U.N secretary calls the agents and tells them that Jason Hauser's body should still be in the morgue but it is missing.

    Jason's mother is hostile to the agents, but his father is polite and open about everything. It is clear that their marriage has taken a shocking amount of damage from Jason's return. Jason's father is convinced that Jason is not Jason.

    The agents discover that Neela and Jason have disappeared. Neela's and Jason’s mother is in a catatonic state, saying that her son has been saved. Castor's body is in the freezer. (0/1d4 sanity loss violence) Jason has contacted his wife Blair Smith. He has asked him to the Canadian side of the border so she can escape with Neela out of Canada. If caught, he uses two of his passengers, Neela and Blair, as hostages. The death of one of them will cost 0/1d6 in sanity loss helplessness.

    There is a chance that the Agents can intercept Jason/Janusz and close the border if they use an appropriate roll to try to track them down using law enforcement with helicopters or satellites. In that case, the scenario should climax in a hostage situation where Agents would have to try to bargain with Janusz. Janusz is just stalling so it can feast on someone’s blood, it is very close to starvation due to the pressing urge to drink the blood of innocents.

If Jason dies after that, Janusz will enter into the nearest dead body, go into stasis and will leave the morgue it’s brought in when unsupervised. If both die, Janusz rams his car against the police and tries to escape. If both escape, Jason will wither and die of bloodthirst in the car. Even though Jason Hauser is dead, Janusz will always live on.
