    A friendly named Thomas is already on the scene and looking into the death of his two neighbors that were found on Monday. Delta Green is getting involved at his request due to the unnatural number of deaths that have happened at this home in Pinto, Colorado. The agents are being sent in under the guise of being private investigators hired by the Long’s family. As they investigate their discussions with Thomas and with other neighbors will prove fruitless in turning up more clues. But investigation of the house will uncover a secret connection to tunnels that spread out endlessly. Within these tunnels is an ancient reptilian beast that is always on the hunt - Palulukang.

    Denver International Airport is a newly developed community which could be considered prime real estate for a young couple wanting to raise a family. The large homes, parks and good schools all seem like the perfect place to live out the American dream. But inside the community of Happy Horses fear is rising as now three different owners have passed away in the home at 1011 Sand Creek Rd.

Inside the home is clean and well furnished. The upstairs has three bedrooms, moving boxes are still piled in one of the smaller rooms. On the main level a family room, kitchen and office. The basement is unfinished and stuffed with moving boxes.

A Computer Science roll of 40 or more will get the agents access to the Long’s home computer and to Calie’s journal which describes their excitement at being able to purchase this home for a very low price. She seems unconcerned about the deaths, until about a week before her death when she notes that in the night she kept hearing strange sounds in the basement and she was unnerved by them.

    Thomas is retired from the Air Force and has had minimal contact with Delta Green during his career as a pilot. After the death of both of his sons and a messy divorce he has settled into the ranch home at 1013 Sand Creek to hopefully get away from his past. When his neighbors at 1011 continue to die he wrongly assumes that the problem must be related to him and some of his previous work with Delta Green.

    Lost Tunnels

  </h2>
  <p class="c2">
   <span class="c1">
    As the Agents explore the home they may hear unusual sounds coming from the basement. Further exploration of the unfinished basement with an Alertness or Search of 50 or more will result in the agent identifying a particular wall from which the sounds are coming from. A thin strip of concrete that appears solid is actually an illusion. Any agent that interacts with the wall must make a Sanity roll 0/1D4 SAN loss.
   </span>

   <span class="c1">
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c2">
   <span class="c1">
    When the first agent enters the tunnels have them roll Luck, a failure indicates the nearby tunnels are currently occupied while a success indicates the agents have plenty of time to investigate freely. Repeated entry should result in additional rolls.

  <p class="c2 c3">
   <span class="c1">
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c2">
   <span class="c1">
    The tunnels are plain concrete, roughly 6’ wide and 12’ tall. Agents may find debris, dried blood or other evidence that something else has been there. If the agents spend a good deal of time exploring it is worth rewarding that risk with them finding one or two other exits which are similarly disguised by an illusion.

    The tunnels are a true maze. If an agent has some way to help them navigate (string, chalk, compass, etc.) give them a +20 to Navigate rolls. Cell phones, GPS, etc. will not work here.

   <span class="c1">
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c2">
   <span class="c1">
    The longer the agents spend in the tunnels the more difficult it should be for them to navigate back to the entrance. At your discretion have the agents roll Navigate anytime they enter an area with multiple branches. Failure to Navigate results in the agent becoming lost. Have them roll Luck again. A failure results in them becoming HUNTED and a success results in them having time to Navigate their way back out. At least one additional successful Navigation roll should be required for them to undo the failure.

    The Hunt

  </h2>
  <p class="c2">
   <span class="c1">
    Palulukang - is a hulking beast, with reptilian features and silvery scales lurking in the tunnels. It has long used this place as a hunting ground, extending the tunnels into new areas to find fresh food for its ever growing domain. Connecting from Denver International Airport, deep into the center of the city and now far south to the growing urban sprawl, the tunnels are a confusing maze of which only it is the master. Once it picks up the scent of prey it will hunt until it has absorbed their vital energy. Encountering Palulukang results in 0/1D6 SAN loss.

  <p class="c2">

    If Palulukang catches an agent it may provide time for the other agents in the party to escape, as the creature needs time to absorb the vital energy from the victims it kills. Using an animal like a dog can also provide a distraction for the agents to escape the hunt. Finally, Palulukang will not expose itself to the open sky.

    Per their orders from Delta Green, the agents are to remove any evidence of the unnatural. It is left to their discretion if they want to destroy or block off the tunnels. An encounter with Palulukang may be deadly for the agents, but if they manage to kill the beast the tunnels will gradually disappear and become inaccessible from the outside.
