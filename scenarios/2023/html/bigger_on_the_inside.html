    On December 2, 2023, a team of Agents is sent by the Program to investigate a Green Box that belonged to Delta Green in the 90's. The existence of this Green Box had been forgotten when Delta Green reactivated in 2002, until retired agent Glenn Donaghy passed away, and it was discovered he had been paying for a storage unit in rural Arkansas for the past twenty-two years.

    , an obscure 1923 silent film that was thought to be destroyed. The film depicts a strange masquerade ball in which men and women in surreal costumes, resembling Belle Époque fashion but with otherworldly masks and features, dance in hypnotic circles, until they are interrupted by a visiting King who removes his mask and- well, the ending of the film is known only to West.

    The film is a vector of infection for the King in Yellow, and it drove West insane. Realizing what was happening, he decided to kill himself, but even in that, he was under the film's influence. On August 28th, 2002, he took the film, walked into the Arkansas Green Box, and beat his own brains out with a pipe. His body disappeared. On September 19th, none the wiser, Glenn Donaghy closed the doors of the Green Box for the last time.

     Agents find an old-timey school bus parked between two walls of junk, blocking the path. The only way forward is through the rear entrance. Inside are nineteen boys and girls listening attentively to Ms. Pryzbylinski, their teacher, as she gives them history lessons on an ancient, sunken city, and the day that a sleeping god will drive the world to euphoric madness. She insists that Agents join the lesson. If they try to negotiate or argue, she pauses for extended lengths of time, making faces as though she were receiving instructions from an unheard speaker. Insightful Agents may deduce, or pry out of her, that she is listening to her own fetus. If they try to leave, she turns violent. Upon death, her stomach bursts open and spills forth a horde of Spanish doubloons caked in sea scum, and a fetid, green thing that gasps for air before dying. When the Agents turn around, the children's bodies are broken and mutilated and covered in fresh teeth marks.

After brief observation, a man's voice can be heard from within the pit crying for help. Any Agent who reaches in finds the pit extends far deeper than four feet, as the voice stops and dozens of living porcelain dolls try to pull the Agent in and kill them. If an Agent decides to “swim” to the bottom rather than flee, they find, ten feet down, the nude, headless corpse of an obese man with holes piercing his palms.

     If a doll bites an Agent, that Agent develops an infection. The skin around the bite starts to itch, then harden, until it becomes evident the Agent's skin is turning into porcelain.

The Agents will at first see him in brief glimpses, striding through corridors on long legs, or peeking through holes in piles of crap. But if they dawdle too long in a single area, he will attack in a screaming rage. He does not speak words, only shouts and strikes. He can be killed, momentarily. But he will come back. Best keep moving.

    After hours or more of wandering, Agents discover what seems to be the edge of the storage unit, with a movie screen playing

    , projected by a hand-crank projector that appears to power itself. Jefferson West, no worse for wear if the Agents fought him earlier, sits cross-legged in front of the screen, laughing like a madman. When the King in Yellow shows up, he points and laughs even harder.

    Agents instinctively recognize the film as the source of corruption. Any Agent who looks at the screen is enraptured by the fuzzy, dreamlike quality of the film, the surreal costumes, the enthralling movements of the masquerade ball. On a failed POW×5, the Agent must watch to the end. Even if they destroy this copy, they will obsessively search for others until they find one, or until the obsession consumes them. If an Agent watches to the end and sees the King remove his mask, truths are revealed to them. Reality is a lie, a fiction that humankind dreamt around the true world, the masquerade, Carcosa. But it's not too late to wake up. It's not too late to join our King.

    Removing the film from the projector and destroying it will return the Agents to the real world and sever the Green Box's connection to Carcosa. But the evil inside will remain until the Green Box and its contents are destroyed.

    At times, Jefferson West is seized by a supernatural, barbaric strength. At these moments, he will try to rip a body part off of an Agent, anything from a finger to an arm to a nose to an ear, and so on. The Handler can decide how much damage this deals, whether stats or affected, or if there is a permanent injury, depending on which body part West removes.

    Ms. Pryzbylinski’s belly unleashes a shriek that can only be heard by the targeted Agent, who rolls a POW×5 to oppose. On a failure, the Agent’s mind is overcome with visions of a vast ocean whose surface is covered in waterlogged corpses, of tentacles the size of islands writhing just beneath the water, of an inconceivably gigantic eye opening deep beneath the sea as it awakens from an eons-long sleep. These painful visions deal 1d6 damage and cost 1/1d6 sanity from the unnatural.

    The porcelain doll bites an Agent and inflicts them with a strange infection. The Agent will notice the skin around the wound start to itch, then harden, until it becomes evident the Agent’s skin is turning into porcelain. The porcelain infection will radiate outward from the wound slowly but steadily. After four hours, an entire limb will be porcelain. After sixteen hours, the whole body. The infection ends upon leaving the Green Box, but the porcelain skin cannot be fixed by anything other than amputation.
