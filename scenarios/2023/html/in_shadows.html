    You are to investigate the purchase of a stone tablet from a thrift store in Flagstaff, AZ, two days ago. Images of the tablet have been uploaded to local thrifting pages, asking for more information about it. The tablet has writings in an unknown language, one that has been associated with unnatural incursions. These posts have been deleted by Delta Green, that aspect has been taken care of. You are to find out who has the tablet, if they’ve learned anything about it, if an unnatural incursion has occurred, and destroy the tablet.

    Samantha Hearst is a local alternative girl, who likes to shop at thrift stores looking for clothes and decor that match her aesthetic. This odd stone tablet fits the bill perfectly. She comes into the store every Saturday, often enough that the employees know her by name. Sometimes they’ll even put stuff aside for her, which was the case with this tablet.

    Hidden treasures has been in business for 10 years, is locally owned and operated by a married couple, Lilia &amp; Susan Booker. They’ve managed to compete with larger chain stores, and are well known members of the community. They have annual toy drives and charity auctions, proceeds going to local groups.

    If asked, any of the employees will remember Samantha buying the tablet two days ago. She was excited to see it, and immediately started trying to figure out what the language on it was. They have security cameras that have a record of the time and date, as well as giving Agents an image of Samantha. None of the employees know her address, but they do have her phone number, so they can tell her when they have things of particular interest for her. The tablet was only there for a couple of hours before she purchased it. It was dropped off with a bunch of other items, all mundane personal effects.

    The two employees working when the tablet first arrived have been having dreams of a forest of tall, white trees, that reach up into darkness. Through the forest they hear the bleating of goats. They have not discussed this with each other yet. They haven’t gotten any rest during the two nights since first encountering the tablet, and this is very apparent from their sluggish demeanor, and bags under their eyes. These effects will fade after a couple more days.

    Samantha has had it worse. She hasn’t left the house since purchasing the tablet, hasn’t slept or eaten either. She has been making minor sacrifices to the tablet, of her own personal POW. This has in turn caused something to be released.

    Samantha lives by herself in a one story rancher, in a quiet residential area. All the houses are roughly the same, each with a small lawn and backyard. The grass is dry and dead. This is in stark contrast to the other houses, with lush green vegetation.

    The first thing the agents will notice around the house is a lack of any animal activity. Elsewhere they’ve heard the croaking of frogs, the buzzing of nighttime insects, even owls. Here it is entirely quiet.

    The entity recognizes that the agents will be a far greater meal than the insects and small animals it has been feeding on. It has kept Samantha alive in order to sap her Power and draw itself forth from the tablet that has trapped it. In her meditation on the tablet she unknowingly created a connection with the entity. Were she more knowledgeable she would have done so when appropriately prepared, in order to summon it forth and control it.
