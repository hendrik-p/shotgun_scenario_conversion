    he players are part of the SCP Mobile Task Force Lambda-6 (MTF Lambda-6), consisting of twelve agents: three scientists and nine soldiers. Before creating characters, the Handler instructs all players to secretly write down the most unsettling place and experience their character has had in their life, along with five adjectives describing a terrifying creature/person and give this info to the Handler. Based on these descriptions, the Handler creates a location and creature for each character. This is used in part 3. The adventure challenges the Handler to describe terrifying places and experiences and quickly improvise horrifying creatures. Here are over 900 pre-gens available for use:

    SCP-7286: A spatial anomaly taking the form of a Spanish tradition, Los Reyes Magos, the three wise men who brought gifts to Jesus. It alters the world around you by taking control of your cognitive functions and creating hallucinations of your greatest fears. SCP-7286 seems to thrive on this and grows larger for each mind it can infiltrate. It is located in the church Parroquia Virgen del Carmen y Santa Fe in Fuengirola, Andalusia, Spain, and takes the form of three crowns. It has created a toxic ash rain that turns people inside out. The rain has a radius of 500m,

    Dr. Guillermo Alejandro Sebastian Rodriguez Hernandez sent in a D-class with designation D-6j61h equipped with a radio to anomaly SCP-7286. A short transcription of communication between Dr. Hernandez and D-6j61h that occurred on 1995-12-24 is attached to your brief. All members of MTF Lambda-6 ("The King Slayer") are equipped with MP5, Glock-17, GPS, tactical protective gear, and a communication radio. The team carries one Geiger counter, one video camera and one spectrometer. Your task is to reach the church, locate D-6j61h with whom we lost communication a day ago, retrieve the body for further examination, and locate the nexus for SCP-7286. Mount the camera and establish communication with Dr. Hernandez. Measure the radiation and install the spectrometer. Dr. Hernandez believes that SCP-7286 is the object located on the altar.

    THE CHURCH:
   </span>
   <span class="c2">
    Half of the unit (including Agent and at least one scientist) is ordered by Dr. Hernandez to enter the church and secure it. The remaining part of the unit is ordered to wait outside. The church is unlocked, and they are greeted by hundreds of burning candles. Some float in the air, but most are scattered on surfaces covered in wax. The church is a typical Catholic one, and at the front, the priest kneels and prays with his back to the door. On the altar lie three golden crowns emitting visible particle radiation that moves in orbits around them. In front of the Agents D-6j61h lies dead. Blood has flowed from all openings. When the equipment is installed, someone from the unit must pass a Science (physics) or INT test at -20% to make the measurements. Note that the priest is not visible on the camera. Communication with Dr. Hernandez gives the following:

  <p class="c3">
   <span class="c2">
    If an Agent touches the priest, a crown, or tries to leave the church, the priest turns towards them, eyes melting, and blood flows from all openings before he explodes into thousands of sharp bone fragments and flesh chunks. Roll SAN (1/1D6). Everything goes black for MTF Lambda-6. The agents are still in the church, eyes to the sky, bodies shaking. They are trapped in their minds and share a common hallucination.

   <span class="c2">
    Choose one of the player's locations. All Agents wake up from the darkness and find themselves in this place. They have all the equipment needed for the scenario. The player's creature is also present and must be defeated for them to proceed. When defeated, the Agents are pushed to the next location, as if they collided with a car. This continues until they have visited all the places they described at the start of the game. If one or all Agents die in one of these places, they wake up in the next place with the others. When the last creature is defeated, the world collapses around them, and everything starts burning.

    Dr. Hernandez has observed how the radiation from the crowns enveloped all members of MTF Lambda-6, putting them in a trance and causing their death.

Dr. Hernandez sends in these D-Class in their orange overalls and three massive cases, which according to him should isolate the radiation from the crowns. Assign each Agent a D-Class designation consisting of "D-" and a total of five numbers and letters, along with new character sheets. The D-Class must secure the crowns. The radiation harms everything living and is deadly with SPEED 1 HOUR, LETHALITY 80%. A person touching the crowns sees horrifying visions and must roll SAN (3/1D10). A D-Class going mad, temporarily or permanently, falls under SCP-7286's control.
