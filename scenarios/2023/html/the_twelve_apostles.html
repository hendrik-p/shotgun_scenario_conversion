    The twelve disciples of the Good Faith Church were preparing for doomsday.  There holy savior, Zachariah Smith, had announced the day of the Apocalypse was near and their pain and suffering would soon come to an end.  His loyal followers, all drifters who had little to live for, were ready to join him in the afterlife and prepared to die with him in unison on the night of the Grand Conjunction.

  <p class="c0">
   <span class="c1">
    Zachariah was more than just a con man though. He needed the life of a dozen willing people to summon the Dark Man to him and grant him immortality.  Zachariah had prepared his mind for years for the ceremony, having traveled to parts of Africa on Missions for the church on multiple occasions.  He secretly studied the death cults of the darkest and remote parts of the jungle.  Zachariah’s mind was prepared, but his body was not.  Overweight and a heavy smoker, he had a massive heart attack while walking down the street, striking his head on a light pole.  Zacheriah now lies in St. Joseph’s Hospital, on the seventh floor in a coma.  Zacheriah’s will is so powerful, he can continue to influence his followers. Should all twelve followers die at their own hands, he awakens, his spell be completed.  Though he isn’t as powerful, they completed the ritual simultaneously.

A bookcase is filled with books on Africa, specifically Congo, languages of various tribes in Congo, traditions etc.  Not present anywhere in the house is a single crucifix or bible.

    Only killing Zacheriah will end his reign of terror.  Distance is irrelevant for him contacting and influencing people.  Eliminating his followers will only delay the inevitable (there are thirty more followers who would gladly take the place of the chosen).  Should twelve followers commit suicide with the pentagram engraved on their body, Zacheriah awakens from his coma.  What effects he has on the world is left to the Handler’s discretion.
