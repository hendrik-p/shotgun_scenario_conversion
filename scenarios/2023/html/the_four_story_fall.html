    The world is a tomb: dark, cold, and still. The agents have gathered in the parking lot of an office building. They’ve been here once before. As they meet each others’ eyes, a shard of glass shatters on the ground at their feet. Then the rest of the glass. Slam the table, if you feel comfortable doing so, because a body is next. A man. Their fellow agent. Mark.

    Players have 15 real-time minutes in each scene. Tell them and provide a timer, where possible.

If they kill him, the next scene plays out as written. He’s back.

    They recognize that address right away. The Green Box was formerly kept in a shipping container, buried under metal and bureaucracy at the local train yard. Mark has leveraged connections to have it set on the back of a flatbed truck. The agents notice this as he passes them on the opposite side of the interstate, heading for the nearest cliff overlooking a deep body of water. He’s cruising at the speed limit and screaming inside.

    The first time agents stand in the shadow of the office building, they do so on Mark’s invitation alone. He’s rented a few feet of carpet and desk at a co-working space on the fourth floor and told the owners he writes escape room narratives. He called dibs on a small conference room for this reunion but a doomed startup is running overtime inside. Two stragglers type in the co-working space while Mark and the agents stand outside the conference room, waiting for it to open.

    Slam the table again if you did it the first time. We’re back to that moment. An agent checks for vitals and the handler rolls for Mark’s survival, as indicated in his stat block. Whatever the result, agents may volunteer to roll helplessness based on their interpretation of the situation up to this point (1/1d4). This is an individual choice and there is no reward for either answer.

    The Massacre:

  </p>
  <p class="c0">
   <span class="c4">
    The co-working space reeks of blood and gunfire. Several bodies drain blood on the floor. They look like civilians, like other people just using this venue. They’ve been shot. A dog is growling somewhere in the offices. It yelps and then: a gunshot. That’s the clip of Mark executing his dog. That’s where his laptop is.

    The laptop is cycling through Mark’s slideshow. The same evidence repeats, but there’s more now: pictures of Mark with his family, pictures of the city, frames from surveillance. Mark has circled a different person in each picture. There are eight pictures like this.

    Six of the pictures capture the likenesses of the six bodies strewn about the building. A seventh captures Jeffery Richardson a week before the incident at the park, staring over Mark’s shoulder at a café.

    Some of these dead people are familiar. The dog walker in the park, the gas station attendant in the chase. A handful of NPCs that seemed unimportant at the time.
