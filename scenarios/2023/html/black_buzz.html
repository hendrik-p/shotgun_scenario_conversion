    college
   </span>
   <span>
    , redeeming his retirement money every month. Bellinger’s mother told him about the old man always doing that; this is when they hatched the plan to rob him. They surprised Henry.
   </span>
   <span>
    Two held him bac
   </span>
   <span class="c2">
    k while the other two searched for the money, which they eventually found. Seeing his granddaughter’s college fund stolen, Henry mustered his last strength and fought the intruders. In the ensuing fight, he got hit by a bullet in the lower abdomen.
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c1">
   <span>
    In fear, the gangsters fled the scene and left Henry to bleed out. In his last dying thoughts, Henry wished for revenge.
   </span>
   <span>
    The Black Wind
   </span>
   <span>
    , an avatar of Nyarlathotep, honoring a contract made in medieval times by Kirsch´s ancestors, listened to his pleading. Bees started to swarm Henry’s body and like a storm of black buzzing bodies, they started to engulf him and dig into him. Kirsch is unnaturally kept alive while simultaneously hollowed out and only his subconscious drives him. A day after his “death,” his body
   </span>
   <span>
    walks,
   </span>
   <span class="c2">
    again searching for his killers.

    After crafting it one has to perform a ritual by chanting the verse all over and sprinkling the Charm with local earth. If the Swarm Charm now hangs close to the bees, they will always return to the hive and produce way more honey.

    The ritual banishes the Black Wind from possessing the swarm of bees similarly to what destroying the Swarm Charm does. To perform the ritual the user has to get a 5 gallon container and chant
   </span>
   <span class="c3">
    “In einem Hauch, der Hoffnung bringt, verbannt der Morgen den Schwarzen Wind, Die Welt erblüht im Licht, der Finsternis entschlungen, das Glück darin beginnt.”
   </span>
   <span>
    three times over the container. It translates to
   </span>
   <span class="c3 c13">
    “In a breath that brings hope, the morning banishes the Black Wind, The world blossoms in light, the darkness vanishes, happiness begins.”
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c1">
   <span class="c2">
    After a successful ritual roll, which can be retried if failed each round, the swarm gets sucked into the container, banishing the Black Wind with it.

    Created by an unknown author, ca. 1500s in the Holy Roman empire. Describes beekeeping and the occult. Beekeepers in old Europe sometimes used swarm charms to guarantee swarms returned home or to boost honey production. Most of it is just occult nonsense, but two hypergeometric rituals can be found within. One establishes a connection to the Black Wind and one to banish it.
