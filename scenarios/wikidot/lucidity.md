 The resort town of Bridgton, Maine has been experiencing shared nightmares for months. Most ignored them at first until aspects became increasingly real. 

+ INTRO
 Have the Agents play a group of teenagers stalking their friend who has been acting strange lately with one of them recording. Their friend Oliver Langston, is acting peculiarly and has gone to find Dr Olmes, a retired DG Agent. Oliver spoke possessed by a deceased HOOVER, who Olmes saw sacrificed by Tcho-Tcho decades ago. Olmes is presented with //an artefact// and panics; O lmes sorcerously commands HOOVER inside as the teens flee. Langston and his artefact are tied up in the basement, catatonic as his friends suppress the terror. Olmes emails A-cell but it was sent to Joe Camp’s old server first leading to both sides of schism having read the plea - should the Handler want, the other side could show up unannounced.

 **Operation GOOD NIGHT: T** he essential information provided by the officer summarises the video and email. 

*  The address of Dr Olmes (see **HARRISON**) with a notably large section of his CIA career is missing but has access to his current whereabouts. 
*  Brighton is presently infested by **spiders** which have been covering the town in sheets of gossamer. Agents with science (biology) at 30% realise this behaviour is anomalous given there have been no reports of weather which would cause this. Online interest assumes the **angel hair**   as being caused by the spiders [[[https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballooning_(spider)&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1704177072946306&usg=AOvVaw3GYcnkXOjZ7AiaG71joW4g | ballooning]]].

*  There is a copy of Harrison’s Email. Agents with psychotherapy at 50% recognise the terminology as being dated to the 1960s - occult or anthropology at 50%  recognise the theories of other planes and realms of reality popular in 19th-century occult circles. For those with any of those skills and unnatural 10%, this incursion is a manifestation of a collective psyche into reality, that the human body when dreaming is literally in another plane. He mentions Langston/Hoover who he ‘detained’ in highly apologetic concerns. 

 The Agents are instructed to: 

*  Determine the stability of HARRISON 
*  Prevent unnatural nightmares. 
*  Follow standing orders. 

+ THE TRUTH
 Underneath the lake lies the Watcher, **Ulwkho** - trapped beneath //weakening// wards carved by the Elder Things - for now, it is just an immense psychic presence. This vulnerability was caught by the treacherous Grey Weaver **Isirix**, who schemes to steal and become gluttonous with the titan’s power. Its webs are cast over the local area and the nightmares will intensify the more it parasitises **Ulwkho’s** power. The screams and rites being performed are causing nightmares and generating phenomena around the town such as the spiders. Its goal is to destroy the ancient Elder Sign placed above its tomb beneath Long Lake, or more plausibly weaken it. Those vulnerable to its presence feel its dream call (see Ulwkho) upon entry, causing them to suffer missing time when they undertake action unconsciousness for 1d4 minutes. 

++ THE DREAMS
 There are two common nightmares consistent in imagery - in the first, the subject feels their body puppeteered as they vomit wet silk in a labyrinthine web. In the second, the dreamer is encased in a labyrinth of shifting walls with hazy five-pointed swastikas in the bottomless mist sky eventually drowning the dreamer. Agents with the Unnatural at 10% and have researched the matter can roll with a +20% to recognise the imagery. The Elder signs are clear and the imagery of webs is common in dreamer cults globally. 

++ THE ARTEFACT
 //**It**// came from the dreaming psyche of **Ulwkho**, a piece of irreality. It is a jewelled bracelet fashioned in bronze with Hyperborean runes inscribed, something recognised with a combined archaeology/history & unnatural of 60%. Cracked agents feel an instinctive wrongness to the object. If the operator succeeds on a POWx5 roll, they hear the unconscious of all within a POWx5 metre radius and see the world through the Voorish sign. This costs 0/1 SAN from unnatural. This includes unnatural entities, and treat SAN tests as if encountering them for the first time. Secondly, it allows the operator to manipulate the dreams of those they hear on a successfully contested POWx5 roll which is used to prevent nightmares. 

+ ESCALATION/SETPIECES
*  **The spiders** to an untrained eye lack significantly unusual qualities beyond their purple-green bodies; those with Science (Zoology) at 30% or similar professions at 40% realise they exhibit eusocial behaviour - the only species known to do this is //Acanthogonatus comis// which are native to Colombia. Significantly larger specimens may also be found. **The silk,** if analysed by an agent with Science (Biochemistry) or related at 30%, finds that it resembles spider silk and has properties such as being as durable as graphene, whilst possessing geometric patterns which resemble brain activity when analysed.            The infestations overlap with the intensity of the dreams - those worst affected by the dreams tend to have the largest amount of silk over their houses. Agents with Unnatural at 10% or Occult at 50% recognise when mapped the pattern resembles a fractal ritual circle implying a centre in another dimension. 
*  **HARRISON:** asking around for anyone who fits the profile of the old agent takes a half hour with a persuade/CHA. He lives   lakeside, in a modernist property; agents with criminology, alertness or Mil-Sci at 50% if not on a roll notice hidden CCTV cameras, motion sensors and integrated security features. 

 HARRISON is old and paranoid, preferring “Inner Space” to reality, treating it as a form of ideational escapism. Being once a DS&T neuroscientist he worked on MKULTRA in the late '60s-'70s, refining access to Inner Space, and serving in Vietnam. But after the theft of his research by OUTLOOK, the end of Delta Green Clearance, and the Church Committee, he chose retirement. In his basement are his green box and prisoner. HARRISON is in the process of applying an exorcism to rid Langston of HOOVER. A luck roll determines Langston's state – success means he is conscious and wants to leave; failure indicates possession by HOOVER's memories, last recalled in 1972 on the verge of death. HARRISON wants to escape reality and is willing to take responsibility if the agents enable his escape to the dreamlands, and is willing to take the fall for the kidnapping. 

*  **Adam Warrick** is a dilettante trust fund scion and a Guardian of the Exalted Circle. After mating with a deep one, he found himself metamorphosing into a hybrid so relies upon illusions to maintain his humanity now. Bound by the psychic commands of Ulwkho, he seeks to rid the threat to his ancestor. He is suspicious of the Agents but will try to aid them with his patchwork knowledge if he learns they are not a threat to them, filling in gaps that may exist. 

++ RESOLUTION
*  **HARRISON** suggests   investigating Inner Space, explaining it and preparing the agents to enter the dimension. He believes “Lengese spider” is behind this so will offer a devil's bargain - petition Tleche-Naka with a psychedelic vial of his essence to use the god’s powers to bring its rogue servitor to heel. 

 Tleche-Naka is a terrible thing its form is terrifying (1d6/1d20 SAN). If petitions are framed as a part of the web going rogue he is willing to empower the agents with his authority to bind this rogue servitor in exchange for the artefact. It will consider alternatives of equal value but if the bargain is taken it will grant them a pathway to Isirix. If offended, Tleche-Naka will devour the dreamers 1/1d8 SAN which will force them to awaken. 

*  **THE RISEN CITY:** The dream of Ulwkho resembles a fusion of Ryleh (Unnatural 10%) and cities from Mu whose architecture it came to appreciate through the eyes of its servitors. Built in cyclopean fashion, the city exists hyperdimensionally, with its circular form containing 2160* degrees. On an INTx5 test, the agent realises this and loses 1 SAN from the unnatural. 

 At the centre of a great craterous structure lies floating Ulwkho, with an immense black silk web engulfing it - on top of which is Isirix. 

 If the bargain was struck with Tleche-Naka the agents feel wrath overcome then make an uncontested ritual activation test at +40 and burn 1 WP until they obtain 3 successes as the extradimensional tendrils of Tleche-Naka rip Isirix back to its web. Without this, Isirix engages in combat, although something similar could be attempted in a contested manner at the cost of 3 POW and 25 WP collectively. 

*  **THE WARD.** Beneath Long Lake is the Elder Sign whose wards contain Ulwkho. Access to it requires both going into the lake and repairing it, a ritual activation roll with 3 permanent POW spent to empower the ritual wards which can be achieved via sacrifice. If detected, Ulwkho will send Warrick and create an aura of power, manifesting his presence in a great psychic effort. 
*  **CLOSING THE BREACH:** If the players are equipped with appropriate hypergeometric means to banish Ulwkho/Isirix, adapt accordingly.   

 **Rewards:** 1d12 SAN from completion, 1d12 if the incursion is fully sealed and 2 San if Langston is rescued. 

+ STAT BLOCKS

 **Ulwkho, the Watcher of the Great one** 

 **STR** 80 **CON** 120 **DEX** 10 **INT** 24 **POW** 50 **HP** 100 **WP** 50 

 **ARMOR:** See DISCORPORATION and DISSOLUTE MATTER. 

 **SKILLS:** Alertness 65%, Flight 60%, Swim 80%, Unnatural 80%. 

 **ATTACKS:** None, Ulwkho is unable to directly attack. 

 **DISCORPORATION:** A successful attack with a Lethality rating of 50% or higher causes the spawn of Cthulhu to explode in a disgusting spray of slime and fragments, effectively destroying it. Whether the spawn is truly dead or eventually reforms is unknown. 

 **DISSOLUTE MATTER:** While most spawns of Cthulhu assume and maintain a recognizable shape, they remain immune to all but the most destructive weapons as their bodies naturally displace and reform. The spawn takes no more than 1 HP damage from any attack except hypergeometry or a heavy weapon with a Lethality rating of 50% or higher. 

 **NON-TERRENE:** The spawn of Cthulhu is at home in nearly any environment. Radiation, pressure, cold, vacuum, and other inimical environments have no negative effects on them. 

 **DREAM-CALL:** Characters who fail the SAN roll when encountering the spawn of Cthulhu experience more than its awful physical presence. A character who fails the SAN roll and is exceptionally sensitive (with INT or POW 17 or higher, or any Art, Occult, or Psychotherapy skill at 60% or better) collapses, overwhelmed by a psychic “shout.” It can only be approximated as a voice shouting or babbling what should be nonsense if it were a voice— yet it is filled with utterly alien meaning and fall into. 

 **RITUALS:** The spawn of Cthulhu manipulates unnatural forces in ways inconceivable to humanity. They can work any ritual, with as much ease, as the Handler thinks fitting. 

 **SAN LOSS:** 1D6/1D20.

 **INHUMAN MOVEMENT:** Warrick can leap, climb, and lope in a wholly inhuman manner. An Athletics test can cover heights and obstacles that would stop a normal human. The Lesser Deep One can move up to 25 kph on land, and 30 kph in the water.
