 A micro-scenario for DGSS2023 

 **Prerequisite:** 

 At least one agent got physically close enough to both take a SAN hit and activate Tsathoggua’s //Hunger// (pg. 248 //Delta Green Handler’s Guide//). [[[https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c4rwqB90yFjmLgOKdzhlJIbqHeyX_PlX/view?usp%3Ddrive_link&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1704177047955511&usg=AOvVaw10npzIltZdKNn7zEuryQKX | Snuggle him!]]] 

 **The Problem:** 

 Tsathoggua did not eat the agent, and instead pulled them under one massive wing. It’s dark, warm, and fluffy. For being so close to a sleeping Great Old One, it’s also surprisingly soporific. The agent is in no danger of being crushed due to Tsathoggua’s Fundamental Control, but their bodily needs remain the same. 

 **Some Possible Solutions:** 

*  //Fall asleep:// No rolls required, just waiting long enough. Strange and slow changes adapt the Agent to their new role… 
*  //Wiggle out:// Requires a successful Stealth roll at -20%. Tsathoggua might be big enough to not notice the Agent getting away. This roll must be made within 12 hours of being grabbed. 
*  //Tickle or pinch the Great Old One:// Roll odds or evens. Odds, the Agent can get out as Tsathoggua shifts. Evens, there’s an earthquake. 
*  //Forcible removal:// Trying to remove an Agent from Tsathoggua’s sleeping grasp without their consent costs the snuggled Agent an additional 1d6/1d10 SAN, but can be achieved with a successful Athletics roll at -40% or a Heavy Machinery roll with no penalty – so long as the extraction team gets the machinery into N’Kai in the first place. 
*  //Air strike:// If an Agent is highly placed enough and has a powerful enough communication device (a satphone, a SITOR transmitter, or something weirder) they might be able to call in a surgical air strike. Of course, they won’t survive, and their pyrrhic victory raises questions about the use of bunker busters on US soil within 300 miles of Waco…
