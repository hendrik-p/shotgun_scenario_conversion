 Operation CALCIUM JIG 

 The ordnance test site at the Innsmouth naval base was hit with a Cease and Desist by environmentalists two years ago and the cleanup found a lot of human skeletons in the ruins of Devil's Reef. The forensic investigators on this are about to go public with a sensationalist title along the lines of "US Navy commits genocide on Atlantis!" The Agents are heading to the investigation's offices in Boston to make this PR problem, and the weird artifacts they recovered, disappear somehow. 

 The Program didn't look too closely and just assumed the bones are from the original raid. Some are, some aren't. A couple of New England-based Cowboys in the CIA have been dumping all their dirty secrets in the area, because "hey who's gonna notice a few more on the pile?" They're looking for the forensics guys too, with barrels of quicklime in the back of the truck. 

 The bones themselves weren't where they should've been, all but the newest ones were arranged in strange patterns below the waves. Agents with Anthropology or History at 40% will recognize the patterns as the end positions of ancient dances, and find local legends saying the drowned dead dance for Dagon on the King Tide. 

 The highest tide of the year, the King Tide occurs at full moon when the Earth, Moon and Sun are aligned at perigee and perihelion and the Earth is closest to the Sun, around January 2nd. 

 Happy New Year. The King Tide is tonight. Those artifacts are floating around the lab with a rhythm. Boston will never be the same.
