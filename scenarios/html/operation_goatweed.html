    The Problem:
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c0">
   <span class="c14">
    Silver Streams, a small town in rural Alaska, has gone completely dark to any form of communication. Transports such as trucks and small flights can get in, but they do not come out. Agents discover that an ecstatic flock — calling them a cult implies too much structure – of between thirty to fifty devotees to Sweet Shub hem in the town; they
   </span>
   <span>
    terrorize the inhabitants and
   </span>
   <span class="c14">
    make travel extremely dangerous.

   <span class="c5 c1">
    The Mission:
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c0">
   <span class="c3">
    Delta Green discovers transmissions from an unregistered short-wave radio praising the glory of Sweet Shub and her children, as well as coded transmissions from an unknown civilian within the town discussing the movements of the Flock and rumors of a Bell deep within the woods. The Agents need to neutralize the Flock, either the hard way or the mystical way.
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c0 c4">
   <span class="c3">
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c0">
   <span>
    Posing as members of another law enforcement agency while in Silver Streams is not as necessary here, as the town is being cordoned off by unnatural forces that aren’t really bothering to hide beyond the remoteness of the location. However, Agents may pose as members of the Bureau of Land Management, Alaskan State Police, or another appropriate agency.
    <br/>
    <br/>
   </span>
   <span class="c1">
    The Hard Way:
   </span>
   <span>
    Incurious or bloodthirsty agents can simply take out the entire Flock person by person, “goat” by “goat” – see the stat blocks at the end. Flock members and “goats
   </span>
   <span>
    ” are
   </span>
   <span class="c3">
    not stupid, nor have they lost any of their competencies from their life before devotions to Sweet Shub. They know the landscape better than any of the Agents present and will not hesitate to use traps, attack in groups, ditch fights, or fast-talk their way out of being killed.
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c0 c4">
   <span class="c3">
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c0">
   <span class="c3">
    This is a slow, grueling, and moderately maddening take on this scenario. Killing a member of the Flock inflicts normal SAN damage and desensitization to violence every time. However, Harvey Abbott (see below) and his militia may come to the aid of the Agents if they realize what they’re doing.

   <span class="c1">
    The Mystical Way:
   </span>
   <span>
    Speaking with Curt Brittany or Klare Reese, or sparing the lives of at least three captured cultists, reveals that there is an unnamed Bell within nearby Pioneer park that hangs from the top of a 200-foot sitka spruce. It’s nothing remarkable – a simple
   </span>
   <span>
    cattle bell
   </span>
   <span>
    tied with a strip of leather to a branch. Talking to enough cultists, or asking Reese to write down her dreams, reveals that anointing the bell with the blood of a “goat” while one is in the throes of a vision brought on by their milk, summons Sweet Shub as a roiling silver-black fog to take the Flock away to an unknown plane. The Flock has not yet
   </span>
   <span>
    rung
   </span>
   <span class="c3">
    this bell, wanting to summon as many followers of Sweet Shub for the trip as they can via their radio broadcasts and attempts at proselytizing.

  </p>
  <p class="c0 c4">
   <span class="c3">
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c0">
   <span>
    The “goat” does not need to be killed by whoever rings the bell, but they must be covered in the goat’s blood. Whoever rings the bell will also be spirited away by Sweet Shub unless protected by an Elder Sign. Ringing the bell costs 0/1d8 SAN, and the costs for observing the resulting manifestation of Sweet Shub are per the

    The Flock:
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c0">
   <span class="c3">
    Thirty to fifty feral cultists of all races and genders live in the woods surrounding Silver Streams, along with a herd of monstrosities that could generously be called “goats” – if dwarf goats had gently-waving cilia instead of fur.  Members of the flock behave much like the maenads of Greek myth, though without the “acceptable” sexiness that the modern male gaze sometimes adds – they are deeply capricious and given to following whims and impulses. They climb trees, defecate where they please, cultivate and indulge in strange mushrooms, eating things not meant to be eaten, set fires, raid incoming delivery vehicles for supplies, sing haunting hymns with no volume control in the small hours of the morning, perform rites to honor Sweet Shub (including human and animal sacrifice), drink themselves stupid, and more. They travel in roving bands of between two and eight, and are constantly on the lookout for mischief to perform

  <p class="c0">

    Hurting members of the Flock is difficult. Hypergeometry always works, but weapons require a lethality of 10% or higher to break through the unnatural resilience bestowed on them by Sweet Shub. The Handler may build a cultist using any of the generic NPCs on pg. 354 of the

   <span class="c12">

   </span>
   <span class="c3">
    and adding the additional stats in the stat blocks at the end of this scenario. Members of the Flock lose only SAN, not any tech or logic skills, when they join. They are not “barbarians”, though Delta Green may see them as being in need of a “civilizing” influence (or total eradication). The Flock is full of clever, thoughtful, complicated people — but they are united in their total devotion to Sweet Shub.
