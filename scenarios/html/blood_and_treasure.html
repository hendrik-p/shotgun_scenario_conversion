    Daniel Annelli, a South Australian motorcycle outlaw. His big arms are covered in veins and faded tattoos. A bull neck with gold chains. A low hat.

    The blood harvested here is not sold. Theodore McCaffrey is paying the conspirators with treasure from the lowest pit. It is infinite, he says, generated by the largesse of God, but in fact it was piled there by zealots of a previous generation. The blood goes to something that has been growing since the time of the Spanish Empire. The treasure will run dry before the project is complete.

    He worked as the phlebotomist for a Sihanoukville blood gang and is wanted in Yunnan for selling immunocompromised blood to a hospital. He encountered Daniel Annelli in the belly of a freighter and enlisted with the conspiracy. His green-furnitured AR-15 is braced on a container's edge.

    The guardians, unspeaking, live in appalling stricture, devoting themselves heart and soul to the cause of protecting the one sacred place in the universe. Generations have known nothing but its defense, nothing but their insular culture of pain and sublimation, while the conspirators live in plenty, devouring food and drink and drugs on their sumptuous beds in the chambers below. The guards sleep on freezing stone and post watch in the empty darkness, nothing to feed their souls but their visions of a many-bodied blood serpent's blessings.

    There are slippery chutes in the walls, natural stone pits with blue electric lanterns hanging above. This is where the corpses go, and sometimes half-alive conspirators. The largest chute of all has a gentle slope and leads down into a spiraling hallway. It is lined with rooms full of armchairs and tables, shelves of liquor and coolers of cake, murals of tropic places or murderous and indiscriminate erotic scenes, bedrooms untouched or disheveled with blood and cut-off zip ties.

    Red lines writhe weightlessly in the air, vibrating so that they can barely be fixed in the eye. Arching cascades of blood stream slowly through fixed tendrils. Lengths bundle and unbundle, so that the thing seems to have multiple centers of gravity. Lattices of coursing blood hang from it like torn spiderwebs, and free-running ends seek through the cracks of the cavern unsteadily like something newly born casting about for succor.

    Failure means irreversible circulatory commingling. Within moments, the nervous system will also become linked to that of the lattice. The individual will very quickly become indisputably one organism (though not one consciousness) with the Manifold Blood Lattice, and be incapable of acting against it. The individual's HP and half their INT is added to that of the lattice, though this will subside over time as the individual is distributed across the entire superstructure.
