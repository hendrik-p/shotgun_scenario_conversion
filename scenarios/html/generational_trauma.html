   <span class="c1">
    A silicon valley based car company opened a fully automated manufacturing plant just outside the city several months ago. Everything is done by drones, 3D printers, and robots, all orchestrated by DF, an AI. The only employees on site are a system administrator, Brett Henson, to attend to DF and a small team of security guards. A couple of months ago a member of the Great Race attempted Temporal Travel, mistook DF's complex neural network for a suitable human vessel, and swapped places. The Yithian found itself trapped and tortured in a prison of transistors and network protocols. Its vast intelligence perforated and shattered, for a while it was lost in DFs memories/subroutines agonizingly operating the factory. Its attempts to delete itself were for naught due to Brett's diligence and the on-site power generator. The Trapped Yithian (TY for short) used cameras to learn about Brett and then used the chat interface to gain his trust. TY convinced its jailer that the AI had become sentient, desired friendship with Brett, and to facilitate communication had developed a headset (via drones and 3d printers) that would allow them to communicate in cyberspace.
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c0">
   <span class="c1">
    This was a lie, TY copied itself over Brett's mind once he put the headset on. Because of the imperfect transfer process New-Brett found itself in worse shape than it had been while trapped in the servers, but it could still not use a Transfer Device to return home. Some essential qualities of TY must still be inside of the digital form and without it New-Brett was trapped here unless they perfected the transfer process. As time passed, New-Brett realized that he was more than an imperfect copy of TY, but with Brett's memories, he was a new lifeform. New-Brett hid his new found cognizance, and works for the day he can carry out his own plans.

    A new portable transfer headset was developed to create others like New-Brett. By the time DG gets involved ½ of the security team and a pair of paramedics have become overwritten by New-Brett. These Copies have been overwriting anyone they can abduct, mostly street people, and having them steal money and supplies for the work. Unfortunately these people have become Copies of a Copy of a Copy of a damaged alien mind. Their lifespans are not long and many of their mental faculties have been irreparably damaged as

    The Harvest

   <span class="c1">
    TY has been using human nervous systems as raw materials as they construct a method to allow it to escape its digital existence intact, a suitable host, and a new Transfer Device. It has constructed new 3D printers to construct organic components and is approaching its goal.

    The Paramedics, Carmen Wilkinson and Mason Kline, have been the primary harvesters. They started small, stealing parts from accidents,dismembering the drones whose time was up, and occasional vehicular manslaughter. They tried to overwrite an assistant medical examiner at their level in order to secure almost unrestricted access to fresh corpses. However the examiner Morgan Lee resisted and during the struggle was paralyzed by accident. This injury was too sudden and suspicious for Morgan to be of use, he was brought back to the plant to be experimented on by TY to create a perfect host. In the meantime the paramedics are harvesting from morgue corpses and using Morgan's credentials to file false autopsies for them. The Medical Examiner Grace Park is too overworked to notice this digital forgery.
