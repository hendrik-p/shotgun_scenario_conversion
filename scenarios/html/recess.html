   <span>
    This scenario was inspired by the 1994 Ariel School Encounter, an alleged mass contact event by schoolchildren in Zimbabwe. This scenario is presented as a similar event, though several days beforehand, in the continental United States. This scenario deliberately places MAJESTIC agents out of their element; it’s one thing to threaten and intimidate adult witnesses, but how would they manage to handle a large number of children, as well as their teachers and parents? Feel free to use the children to make the Agents’ lives miserable — “Hey mister, what do you have in that briefcase there?” and so on. How upset would a classroom of children be if men in suits came into their art class and started shredding their drawings of the spaceship from recess? You know what to do.

    , 80 second and third graders (along with their teachers) on the playground noticed a silvery craft descending from the sky, hovering low near the ground, before extraterrestrial beings exited the craft, making psychic contact with six children and two adults, before the craft departed. All present witnessed the craft, a silvery saucer-shaped object, hovering no more than five feet off the ground near the jungle gym as three small beings with large heads and eyes materialized outside the craft and silently stood in front of a group of frozen children and the two recess monitors for a period of less than thirty seconds, before both they and the craft disappeared. A scene of panic soon gripped the playground, as teachers attempted to hurry the children present back inside. Word began to get around the school, and a special assembly was called by the principal and teachers in the cafeteria to address the frightened and confused children. Afternoon classes resumed shortly afterwards, with anxious students traveling home to further spread the story to incredulous family members. Word began to get out as parents phoned each other to confirm the fantastic story told to them by their frightened and amazed children; as details were confirmed, the story began to spread throughout the community.

  <p class="c6">
   <span>
    Tomahawk Elementary is a small elementary school on the outskirts of Olathe. Class sizes are relatively small; no more than 15-20 students, with the school accommodating kindergarten to fifth grades. The events of the previous day have still shaken the student body, but classes are continuing as usual, so much as they can. Principal Davidson

   </span>
   <span class="c0">
    has made every attempt to squash discussion of the event by the student body, but it remains a source of wild speculation within the teachers lounge. If the manifestation of the craft left them with difficult to answer questions, the arrival of the Agents will only bring more.

    At the site of contact, the grass is coated in a strange, powdery substance in a perfect circle thirty feet across and has begun to turn brown. Paint on nearby playground objects has bubbled up and scorched, as if exposed to an intense, short-term heat.

    Principal Jack Davidson — A man in his mid forties, having previously worked as a fifth grade math teacher before becoming a school administrator. He did not personally witness the craft and thinks that for the most part, the children merely witnessed something mundane and their overactive imaginations have caused them to be gripped with a very real fear. He finds the reactions of the adult witnesses much more unsettling. He will be reluctantly willing to cooperate with the Agents, but less so if he perceives them as threatening his staff or especially his students.
