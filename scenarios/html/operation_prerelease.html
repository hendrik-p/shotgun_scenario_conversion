    Pre-Game Notes
   </span>
  </h1>
  <p class="c1">
   <span>
    This scenario is for Agents in the Program. They may be of any experience level or focus, but should still be able to relate to “normies” easily. At least one Agent should legally be able to carry out violence as part of their mundane duties. Background knowledge of far-right violence is a plus.
   </span>

   <span class="c12">
    The Drive
   </span>
  </h1>
  <p class="c1">
   <span class="c3">
    The case officer directs the agents to pick the target, a college student named Kay Orison (see below), up from Northshire Park at 9:05am. From there, it’s about an hour to the Spokane Health Center via I-90. Agents can use this time to get to know Kay and discuss their concerns. This is not a difficult drive and there is minimal traffic.

    Kay Orison

  </h2>
  <p class="c1">
   <span class="c3">
    Kay Orison is a student at University of Idaho CDA in their early twenties, double-majoring in Industrial Tech and Cybersecurity. Their parents are longtime friends with the case officer. Usually extroverted and chatty, Kay tries to keep up banter with Agents but it quickly becomes apparent they would rather just stare out the window and get this over with. The unwanted pregnancy turned their carefully-planned world of acapella group practice, classes, parties, and football games upside-down. They haven’t been sleeping much, eating has been a chore, and the pregnancy weighs on them.

  </p>
  <p class="c0">
   <span class="c3">
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c1">
   <span class="c3">
    Agents who gain their confidence hear about how Kay had sex with a classmate on the rowing team, and the condom “fell off”. They took Plan B the day after, lost the guy’s number, and thought nothing of it — until they missed a period, developed psoriasis on their hands and feet, and stopped being able to eat without extreme nausea. The nausea proved an especial concern, as the vomit appeared to be composed of frog eggs coated in bile. Kay is also dealing with repeated nightmares of drowning on dry land, trapped behind glass while unseen eyes watch and delight.

    Kay may be of whatever gender the Handler prefers, so long as they can give birth. It’s insinuated that she was impregnated by an Innsmouth boy, but is left deliberately vague to fit other Unnatural creatures.]

    The Clinic
   </span>
  </h1>
  <p class="c1">
   <span class="c3">
    The Spokane Health Center is a two-story brick building with plate-glass double doors and flower boxes on the first floor windows. The lobby is clinical but not cold, painted in a soft yellow color. Classical music plays quietly over speakers in the ceiling. The chairs are worn but comfortable, and the magazines are only a couple of months out of date.

  <p class="c0">
   <span class="c3">
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c1">
   <span class="c3">
    Kay’s appointment begins at 10:30am. While one or two agents may be allowed back with them, an entire team draws polite but suspicious refusal from clinic staff. Attempts to force one’s way into the back result in Kay being deeply upset and the clinic staff calling the police.

    Conversation with the receptionists reveals that it’s a quiet day. Normally there are protestors out front, usually from 40 Days To Life or Church At Planned Parenthood, but sometimes they get a reprieve.

    The Attack
   </span>
  </h2>
  <p class="c1">
   <span class="c3">
    At 11:57am, a green box truck crashes through the lobby of the Health Center. Failing to dodge the shrapnel inflicts 1d6 points of damage, a direct is at 10% lethality. A man climbs out of the truck, wearing a tactical vest and an army surplus helmet. The vest contains several ammo pouches, patches of St. Michael the Archangel and small feet, and a d-ring with several dozen zipties attached.
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c0">
   <span class="c3">
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c1">
   <span class="c3">
    The assailant attempts to murder the clinic staff first, and then zip-tie patients to chairs or doors. He does not directly attack any pregnant people. His truck also contains four full gas cans, at least one incendiary device, and several different types of barricades.
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c0">
   <span class="c3">

  <p class="c1">

    If Agents fire or otherwise attack him, they become priority targets. The shooter uses the wreckage as cover, and returns fire unless incapacitated or overpowered.

  <p class="c1">

    If the Agents do not intervene, he shoots two receptionists and a nurse and is making his way upstairs before the local police arrive.

    Aftermath
   </span>
  </h1>
  <p class="c1">
   <span class="c3">
    Kay’s doctor wrapped up the D&amp;C procedure about 30 minutes before the attack. They were recuperating upstairs and locked themselves in the recovery room; they won’t unlock the door unless the Agents successfully reassure them it’s safe. Exhausted, scared, and in pain, they want to be taken home as soon as possible. They may physically cling to an Agent who expressed care or support for them earlier in the scenario as they’re led through the parking lot. Kay may become a Bond at the Handler’s discretion, but they suffer mental and physical complications from the attack either way.
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c0">
   <span class="c3">
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c1">
   <span class="c3">
    Once the attacker is dead or in custody, local police want to question the Agents. Anyone carrying a weapon is a person of special interest. This is standard procedure and will take several hours; Agents can get out of it with a call to their case officer.
