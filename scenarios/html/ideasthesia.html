    Thomas Meyer, a 56-year-old chemist has committed a murder-suicide at his workplace in Tampa, Florida. His employer was the perfume manufacturer Fulvio Eneide. Thomas killed himself and Sebastian Clark on the night of October 14, while also destroying large parts of the company's laboratory using an improvised explosive device. In his office, scribbled on his desk was a note bearing the lines:
   </span>
   <span class="c4">
    The mask of self-deception was no longer a mask for me, it was a part of me

  </p>
  <p class="c5">
   <span class="c7">
    Meyer previously worked in the company’s R&amp;D department with a project to synthesize new scents using an AI powered randomizer with artificial pheromones. Similar to the case of a thousand monkeys with a thousand typewriters, the AI created something of horrendous serendipity, labeled Ylang-33.

  </p>
  <p class="c5">
   <span class="c9">
    To humans, Ylang-33 is an aromatic, complex, and musky scent. However, to insects, including the common house ant, who communicate using pheromones, it's a nightmarish virus. Translated through the insect's olfactory center it is equivalent to a written record of the dreaded play

    Favoring the fragrance of Ylang-33, Meyer used it personally and also brought a sample home. There it acted as a catalyst for the insectile fauna. In particular a colony of house ants has become the vessel for Carcosa. While an individual ant cannot wholly comprehend the force that is
   </span>
   <span class="c4">

   </span>
   <span class="c7">
    , a colony of ants act similar to neurons in a brain, carrying the taint into its hive mind. Growing strange and monstrous, they in turn inflicted the taint on Meyer as well as his neighbor, Janice Brown. In the attic lies the Hive, where their feeble insectile minds try to translate the substance’ message into something that can bring more citizens into Carcosa.

    The Agents are contacted and gathered in a conference room at Tampa Airport on October 15 and are told of the murder. The phrase on Meyer’s desk is flagged as extremely dangerous and related to a forbidden French screenplay from 1895, connected to mass hysteria and bloodshed. The Agents are told to investigate and stop this vector using extreme prejudice.

    Fulvio Eneide is cordoned off. The two-story building has been ravaged by the explosion. The blast was located in the laboratory which is completely destroyed, as well as the remains of both Meyer and Sebastian Clark. Local police on site have concluded that Meyer jury-rigged the bomb using chemicals available on site and that he detonated it when Clark, a nighttime security officer, discovered him.

The only odd thing he did for the last year was complaining about ants in his home, but for the last month he worked primarily from home. If asked about, Ylang-33 has had no strange effects on anyone else at the office.

    The Bergamo is a small, Italian lunch restaurant that was temporarily closed due to a health inspection four weeks ago, after repeated (mundane) ant infestations. The owner, Ravenna Michels, lives nearby and can be contacted via the restaurant's website. If given proper credentials, she is willing to allow the Agents to inspect the restaurant. She is however unwilling to discuss the reason for closure. If pressed (requires some type of skill roll) she divulges ant infestations in the kitchen and vents over the last months. She has previously checked in on Janice regularly, but hasn't done so since the closure. She never talked to Meyer.

    The dining area is dusty and of little interest. In the kitchen there are many insect traps as well as several yellow, bulbous ants close to a large ceiling vent. If an Agent reaches into or closely inspects the vent, a mob of ants emerges, herding several Black widow spiders. The nearest Agent must manage a

    Janice Brown, 82,  is a retired receptionist, suffering from dementia. She has been affected by the Hive and its gospel. She does not let the Agents into her tiny apartment willingly, but opens the door partially, with the security chain still on. She seems happy but confused. She does not wish to be disturbed as she is

    . On the topic of Meyer, she seems ignorant, they had little contact. From her bedroom beyond, vague voices can be detected as well as whiffs of Ylang-33. In her pocket are the keys to the attic.

    If the Agents break into her apartment, they find it empty. Furniture has been moved to the walls in the bedroom and a tiny, circular theater the size of a shoebox is placed in the center of the floor. On it are several insects moving like performers of a play. In the middle is the empty vial of Ylang-33. On the walls are ants forming the shape of words, citing

   <span class="c9">
    The ants' nest is located in the locked attic. It is an enormous colony taking up the entirety of the cramped area. It reeks of Ylang-33. It seems like the hive is impossibly large and resembles a madman's sand castle with spires, spinous outcroppings, and galleries. Strange pinpoints of light can be seen in it. In the farthest part of the hive, a mesmerizing abyss is enclosed in the hive, about 15 inches wide. Faint orchestral music and shrouded reflections of black stars can be discerned from it.

    When the Agents arrive in the attic hall it's quiet. As they approach the abyssal portal, the Queen emerges. She is a bulbous mutated form, the size of a large hound. From huge glands on her back emerge odoriferous clouds that cause vivid hallucinations of black stars over the lake of Hali.
