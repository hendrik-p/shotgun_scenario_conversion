    The Truth
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c2">
   <span class="c1 c5">
    In the 1970s there were four members of F-Cell: agents Fenton (Millie Van Owen), Frederic (Roland Brevik), Frankie (Allison Hall), and Forbes (Scott Ortega). Under the guise of a CIA task force, they conducted Delta Green operations in South Africa, Namibia, and Angola. What The Program knows of F-Cell is limited to what was relayed in the messy “Cowboy Years” and their debrief in 1994 when Delta Green resurfaced.
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c4">
   <span class="c1 c5">
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c4">
   <span class="c1 c5">
    In reality, from 1976 to 1985 F-Cell operated as judge, jury, and executioner of any threat, unnatural or not, that got in the way of it acquiring local power. Infighting and greed grew.
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c4">
   <span class="c1 c5">
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c2">
   <span class="c1 c5">
    In 1978 F-Cell was assigned to covertly train rebels in Angola. While there, they conducted Operation New Claret, a cult raid on “The Headless Men”. During the raid agents Fenton, Forbes, and Frankie murdered Frederic by “blowing his head off”. They had ruled him a security risk after he admitted to dreaming of “a headless man behind a brick wall” and had threatened to inform the CIA about F-Cell’s “extra-curricular” activities. Frederic was reported KIA. The remaining agents settled in to a pattern of debauchery, extortion and violence.
   </span>

   <span class="c1 c5">
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c2">
   <span class="c1 c5">
    Among Frederic’s possessions was a wooden honeycomb amulet that Fenton took. The amulet convinced her the only way to survive was to replace her head with that of a sacrifice, which she did in 1980.
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c2">
   <span class="c1 c5">
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c2">
   <span class="c1 c5">
    In 1985, Agent Frederic’s body was reanimated by the cult. The same year F-Cell was recalled stateside. Roland followed, Thompson gun in hand, crossing the Atlantic Ocean on foot over the next 27 years.

   <span class="c5">
    After a 5 mile drive off the main road through the mountains, the agents come to a long gravel driveway in the woods. The two-story home overlooks a valley on one side, and the dense forest and gravel road on the other. Done in the modern style, accents from Fenton’s past adorn every room. The house is replete with large floor to ceiling windows which allow a near 360

    The 2nd floor office contains live surveillance on every room (except for the basement) and the outdoor grounds. The circuit breaker is here. Fenton has access to these feeds through her phone and watch. Every room is wired to a universal sound system. She has set up 2 tripwire grenades and a claymore mine covering any advances through the forest.

Her current head is that of Elizabeth Cotten, a similar-looking foreign aid worker she kidnapped and beheaded in 1980.

   <span class="c1 c5">
    67-year-old CIA-consultant and former DG Program agent. Looks younger than her case file states (“A healthy skincare routine”). In the process of shredding files in the main hall when the agents arrive. Presents as a capable veteran with an outré and flirtatious personality. She knows it is Roland who is hunting her. Her ultimate goal is to return to Africa, and finish off the Cult of the Headless Men.

    When questioned about her past she will lie, bargain, seduce, and attack to survive. Regarding Roland, she will cite his communist sympathies, endangering F-Cell by threatening to inform on them, and his use of “geometric magic”. If threatened, she will act accordingly. Skilled in years of guerilla and psychological warfare, she will use the house to her advantage, blasting music, using security cameras, cutting power. Doesn’t believe in the concept of a fair fight. Can lead the agents into an ambush in the forest. Can take the fight to them using hidden firearms. Can promise information on Delta Green’s past or $250,000 in bribe money. As a last-ditch tactic, she will show the agents her basement, playing the part of a cult victim unable to stand up to the deity that commands her.

    Arrives when the handler desires. The stench of 27 years in the ocean precedes him. He will announce his arrival with a full magazine blast from his Thompson gun(40 round drum magazine), destroying windows, flowerbeds, and the agents’ car. Roland is a champion of Y’Golonac, here to revenge himself on Fenton. Roland will not stop until her head has been removed from her body. He moves with purpose but not alacrity and will never seek cover. If shooting is an option, he will always take it. Has an inexhaustible amount of ammunition, and two M34 smoke grenades. If the agents give him Fenton, he will leave them be.
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c16 c19">
   <span class="c1 c5">
    Once Fenton’s head has been removed, Roland will place the amulet around his neck, access the basement, and destroy Fenton’s original head in the deep freeze. Finally at peace, Roland’s body will fall limply to the floor.
