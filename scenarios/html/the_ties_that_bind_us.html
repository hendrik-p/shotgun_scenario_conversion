After one too many unannounced disappearances and unanswered questions, his wife was ready to divorce him and take the kids with her. Byron decided to use a hypergeometrical artifact he found on an operation three years ago to fix his family. It worked. His family adores him now. They love him zealously. They have never been happier together.

    SURVEILLANCE AND INVESTIGATION:
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c1 c6">
   <span class="c0">
    If the Agents conduct surveillance on Agent Byron’s house and family, they may observe the following:
   </span>
  </p>
  <ul class="c11 lst-kix_q60755vtgo3a-0 start">
   <li class="c1 c7 li-bullet-0">

     Agent Byron’s routine is inconsistent. He mainly goes to work in the Department of State building in DC, but he sometimes flies abroad for weeks at a time.

   <li class="c1 c14 li-bullet-0">
    <span class="c0">
     Every week, Byron goes on a night trip to the city to break into a blood bank or to kill a homeless person or drug addict to feed the artifact their blood.

     His wife, Sylvie, is a housewife. She only leaves the house for errands and the rare social event so as not to arouse suspicion. Otherwise, she spends the entire day in the house, worshiping a shrine built to her husband in her bedroom closet, masturbating and carving tiny, trailing slashes on her stomach to show her undying devotion.
    </span>
   </li>
   <li class="c1 c7 li-bullet-0">
    <span class="c0">
     His son, Felix, drives to school every day. He’s the star lacrosse player and swim team captain. In his free time, he enjoys torturing little animals using chemicals from his favorite teacher’s chemistry storage room.
    </span>
   </li>
   <li class="c1 c7 li-bullet-0">
    <span class="c0">
     His daughter, Emily, goes with her brother to school every day. She’s the president of the drama club and a varsity member of the track and field team. She has successfully driven three girls to suicide online, and she’s manipulating the drama club vice president to do the same.
    </span>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="c1">
   <span class="c0">
    Asking around the neighborhood and/or looking in relevant records, the Agents can learn the following:

  <ul class="c11 lst-kix_fw51l7cjnoqy-0 start">
   <li class="c1 c7 li-bullet-0">

     Police records show two separate visits to the house. In one instance, the parents were arrested for the night. The more recent of the two occurred three-and-a-half years ago.

     The Richards family is the portrait of a perfect family. But this was not always the case. The neighbors say that divorce was once likely, but the parents suddenly reconciled three years back.

     A neighbor thinks Sylvie is having an affair with someone. They saw her on her knees in the bedroom during the day before she closed the curtains.

    DIRECT APPROACHES:
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c1 c6">
   <span class="c0">
    If the Agents interview the family members, they all describe their family life as fantastic. If confronted with evidence of their previous behavior, they say it’s all in the past now. All family members will inform Agent Byron about the questioning. Eventually, Byron even invites the Agents to dinner to discern their interest in him (after hiding evidence). If he finds out they’re with the Program, he’ll try to corrupt them with the artifact or kill them.
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c1 c6">
   <span class="c0">
    Breaking into the house, the party finds Sylvie’s shrine in the master bedroom’s closet. Felix’s drawers have several knives and chemical compounds underneath clothes. Emily’s laptop, if hacked, contains her malicious online activities.

    MORE HELP FROM THE PROGRAM:
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c1 c6">
   <span class="c0">
    The Program is reluctant to provide any more information about their operations to the Agents unless they show a legitimate reason for it. If convinced, the Program may provide extra help:
   </span>
  </p>
  <ul class="c11 lst-kix_vbz8a1w5sas9-0 start">
   <li class="c1 c7 li-bullet-0">
    <span class="c0">
     The Program sends the after-action report for Operation HARPSICHORD, which occurred three years ago. The agents destroyed a radical Christian cult consisting of a charismatic preacher and several local families in the Appalachian Mountains. There is no mention of anything taken by the agents.
    </span>
   </li>
   <li class="c1 c7 li-bullet-0">
    <span class="c0">
     The Program arranges a meeting between one Agent and one of Byron’s fellow agents.
    </span>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <ul class="c11 lst-kix_vbz8a1w5sas9-1 start">
   <li class="c1 c14 li-bullet-0">
    <span class="c0">
     Agent Keates (George Huang): He is incredibly paranoid and won’t provide much useful information. But, he won’t tell anyone about the meeting, especially Byron.
    </span>
   </li>
   <li class="c1 c14 li-bullet-0">
    <span class="c0">
     Agent Anne (Isabelle Sellers): She once had a fling with Byron after a difficult mission. She’ll tell what she knows to the Agents, but she may contact Byron to let him know about her meeting.
    </span>
   </li>
   <li class="c1 c14 li-bullet-0">
    <span class="c0">
     Agent Tennyson (Will Nichols): He is under Byron’s control. He’ll make whatever lie to please the Agents, then inform Byron.

   <span class="c12">
    ESCALATIONS:
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c1 c6">
   <span class="c0">
    If the investigation is progressing too slowly, a family member goes over the edge. A neighbor calls the police after witnessing Sylvie walk outside naked and bleeding, Felix is arrested for animal cruelty, or Emily is expelled for harassing and encouraging the suicide of her fellow students. Byron uses the artifact gratuitously and visibly to iron out the wrinkles of life and return the world to a perfect, idyllic state.
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c1 c6">
   <span class="c0">
    If the Agents investigate the site of Operation HARPSICHORD, they find the ruins of a chapel in the mountains. A thorough investigation reveals the preacher’s Bible, with highlighted passages about wifely submission to their husbands, adherence to authority, etc. A damaged phone has scattered notes about the preacher’s experiments with the artifact.
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c1 c6">
   <span class="c0">
    If Byron is aware of the Agents’ investigation, he tries to appeal to Agents individually, talking about the tolls of his time with the Program on his family Bonds. He’ll offer to help repair the Agents’ damaged Bonds—he knows what the Program does to families like his and the Agents’.
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c1 c6">
   <span class="c0">
    Failing that, Byron tries to flee with his family. He’ll corrupt Agents with the artifact or corrupt others to hinder the Agents’ pursuit of him. His family will fanatically protect him, even if it means committing atrocities or sacrificing themselves to help him get away.
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c1 c5">
   <span class="c0">

  <p class="c1">
   <span class="c12">
    AFTERMATH:
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c1 c6">
   <span class="c0">
    The Program wants to hear about the Agents’ Star Chamber verdict. If they deemed it necessary to kill Agent Byron and they disclosed the existence of the artifact, the Program wants possession over it. If kept alive, Byron will improve the Bonds of any Agents who allied with him, but quickly disappear with his family afterwards, resulting in damage to any Bonds previously improved. The Program will, of course, come back knocking once they find out that Byron disappeared.
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c1 c6">
   <span class="c0">
    Byron’s family, if still alive, all fall into a severe depressive state. After Sylvie’s suicide, the children are placed into a mental institution for their protection. Agent Tennyson is also out of commission, and the Program vigilantly watches the remaining survivors of Task Force EDDA for signs of unnatural corruption—or they give the Agents the order to euthanize them. Just in case.
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c1 c6">
   <span class="c0">
    Byron’s artifact remains a powerful tool to warp the minds of those around it. Are any Agents desperate enough to use it?
