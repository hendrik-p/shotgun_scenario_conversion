    Two people are in the garage – identifying as Delta Green agents Raccoon and Rosehip. Eventually, Rosehip appears, offering a way out in return for guns and access to an

    The interesting item is a weaver pendant that grants the wearer protection from the worm. Rosehip and Raccoon know this and want the protection it offers before they leave. They are aware the area is encircled with only one way out. The bridge to civilization is blocked, and miles of flat farmland provide little cover for exfiltration.

    If Rosehip gains access to the house, which they claim not to have been inside, they may eventually notice the injured Jester. They will effectively critically fail a SAN test and flee, wide-eyed back into the barn, refusing to return.

    After the agents meet Rosehip, the team are on the clock. Allow each player an action, which could be to fortify an area (there are front and back doors and a dozen windows over both floors), switch lights on and off, set traps with

    After each round of actions, roll a d6. If the agents failed a stealth action or made obnoxious noise, add 2. On a 6+, they’ve telegraphed their location and a cultist will pick the closest window to smash, or door to attempt to enter. They will be basic NPCs armed with hand weapons and should not individually pose a threat – the aim here is to slow the players down until the Worm appears and to force them into making mistakes. Cultists will go through the motions of combat and calmly accept their fate, whispering creepy messages of love and understanding as they lunge and dodge.
